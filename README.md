# clusterQ
A clustered Q-learning algorithm with M-out-of-N cluster bootstrap for making inference on tailoring variables for optimal dynamic treatment regimes (DTR) from clustered sequential multiple assignment randomized trials (clustered SMART). This tool is developed based on paper by Speth, et al. (2024).
